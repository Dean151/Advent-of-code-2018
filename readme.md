# Advent of code 2018
**Made with Xcode 10.1 and Swift 4.2**

## My goal
Trying to solve each puzzle each day. I hope I'll have enough time and motivation to do so.

## My own rules

The puzzle will be solved in Swift ; but not in playground like last year (that was a mistake).

No cheating. Many other person do the puzzle. I'll have to come up with my own solution ... or skipping a day.

Some code may be reused from one day to another.

Not all special cases will be treated by the code.

Some attention will be ported to performance consideration, let try to make that less than 5 seconds per day!
